    </p>
  </ul>
<h2>Competing</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Once players have been selected to compete at a certain day, they will be given a time that they will have to be on. Selected contestants will then be invited to a private session. </li>
  <li><strong>Amount of players per session:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Contestants will be invited to an invite only session </li>
      <li>The Private sessions will only contain a MAX amount of 8 players per session along with 2-3 judges. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Actual Competing</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Once all contestants and Judges are in the session, this is when the competition will begin and pre-selected players will dogfight 1v1. </li>
      <li>Contestants will then dogfight in a best 2/3 death match. Winner will then move on to the next round. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Setting up</strong>
<ul>

  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Dogfighting Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Starting a dogfight</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Competing contestants will start off at a distance. Once far enough, each player will begin to fly towards one another at the same altitude. As the 2 contestants approach one-another, they will fly past each other. This is when the dogfight begins </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Weapons allowed</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Contestants are allowed to use rockets and cannons to eliminate other players </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Things not allowed</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Going off radar</li>
      <li>Shooting at a contestant when doing the fly by at the start of the dogfight </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Exceptions</strong>
<ul>
  <li>If Contestant 1 shoots Contestant 2 and kills them, but C1 runs into the debris of C2, it still counts as 1 win for C1 and a loss for C2. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Surroundings</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Players may use whatever surroundings they want during a dogfight </li>
      <li>If another player hits their surroudings DURING a dogfight, it will count as a loss for the one who crashed. So be careful flying and be aware of your surroundings</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Starting Altitude</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Contestants will start off at an altitude at the middle height of the map (this may be subject to change) </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Judges</strong>
<ul>
  <li>If conflict arises or disagreement between players as to what is fair or not, the judges will decide the outcome. If the outcome is a tie between judges (if there are only 2), contestants will then have a rematch to re-decide the outcome </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Losing a dogfight</strong>
<ul>
  <li>If a contestant loses a dogfight, they will then be required to leave the lobby. Failure to comply will result in blacklisting of future events </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Winning a dogfight</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Winners will be asked to stay in a lobby until it is their turn to fight once again in the next round. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Responsability of Judges</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Judges will be in each competition lobby ranging from 2-3 judges. </li>
  <li>When a dogfight starts, judges will spectate from a distance the dogfight between 2 players. After each kill in a dogfight, if there is ever a conflict in a dogfight, they will decide on the outcome. </li>
  <li>All contestants will listen to the instructions of the Judges </li>
  <li>If Contestants fail to comply with the outcome judges decide, you will be asked to leave. </li>
  <li>Player who are uncooperative, are poor sports when losing, and create issues, may result in being blacklisted from future tournaments </li>
  <li>Judges being reported for abusing their power or doing things incorrectly will be investigated. If found that they have been abusing their power, or are not doing their job correctly, they will no longer be a judge </li>
  <li>Judges must keep track of score of all players such as
    <ul>
      <li>Who woan and who loss</li>
      <li>What the score between 2 players was</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Judges must then submit the scores to the website's email</li>
</ul>
<h2>Winning the Tournament</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Contestants who have won will  be featured on the front page of the site for the next month so they can boast their achievement. All other contestants who participated will be shown in the full list and what place they finished in  </li>
