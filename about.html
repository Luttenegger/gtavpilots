<article>
<p>This website is for Grand Theft Auto V Pilots and for people who want to become GTA V pilots. I first created a similar website back in 2012. I had a ranking system for people who battled one another. When one person battled another pilot, they would message me about it, and I would make changes to the rank.</p>
<p> I quickly realized that this was a lot of work. The site started to become 'somewhat' popular and was constantly getting messages. This was very time consuming and lead to constant changes. This also lead the top leaders on the ranking list being harassed, because people would be wanting to fight them for the #1 position. This harassement even pushed people asking to be removed from the top 10 list due to constant harassement and stress. This is not what I wanted. So I decided to try something new.</p>
<p>Tournaments! That's right, tournaments. I held a tournament where 1st place was to win 1600 Microsoft points ($20.00). I sent out an invite for the first tournament and got about 32 responses. This lead to a problem since each room of players was limited to 16. So I had to get help from one of my online friends. This tournament was semi-successful and the winner got their 1600 Microsoft points and went on their merry way. </p>
<p>However, this was the only tournament I ever held. This was due to lack of funds. I am not rich, I cannot afford throwing $20 tournaments every week as much as I'd like to. If I could, I would, because I think of it as a lot of fun and enjoying the game. So to help raise money, I put ads on my site using Google Adsense. Everything seemed to be going great! My first month installing the ads my account said I was making over $100 dollars! Wow! This is what lead me to buying the 1600 MS in the first place. But, I did jump the gun on this. 2 or 3 weeks in my site was banned due to &quot;invalid click activity&quot;. So all the money I thought I was going to earn was gone! </p>
<p>This is what ultimately lead to me shutting down the site. The idea was good, but I now had a lack of funding for hosting tournaments. </p>
<p>Now that GTA V has come out and with the new map editor, I am hoping to reboot my pilot battling website. With the help of users and gamers, I will hopefully be able to rekindle the fire of this site. Instead of people constantly battling one another for the #1 spot, I will now hold weekly tournaments. This will allow me to have enough time to prepare, make it so players on the #1 spot won't be constantly harassed (as much), and will make the game much more fun. </p>
<p>Tournaments will be strictly dependent on how much money the website makes. I will try putting some ads up again, but not many, to help create revenue. In addition to this, I will add a donate option for fellow gamers to help contribute keeping the site alive and improve. All profits will go towards the website and competitions. Hopefully with this plan things will work out much more smoothly and things will be way more fun!</p>
